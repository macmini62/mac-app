                    First is to thank you for reading this small self-introduction
                    page.<br/>
                    I am a software engineer who is determined to deliver the best 
                    out of any project. My projects are of well thought and creative ideas that 
                    differ from the rest.<br/>

                    Interests:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    My interest are based on understanding software engineering and cloud computing works
                    in order I can acquire skills for developing a cloud based software. <br/>I love agriculture 
                    particularly animals and this has made me dream of developing a user-friendly and resourceful software 
                    that can be of future and bring about development and growth in the agricultural community 
                    and be of assistance to farmers.<br/>
