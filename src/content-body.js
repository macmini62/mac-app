                    First is to thank you for reading this small self-introduction
                    page.<br/>
                    I am a frontend software engineer who is determined to deliver the best 
                    out of any project. My projects are of well thought and creative ideas that 
                    differ from the rest.<br/>

            <div className="my-interests">
                <h3>
                    Interests:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    My interest are majorly based on using React as it makes coding 'easier'
                    as opossed to using vanilla javascript and HTML.<br/>
                    I would love to develop an interactive application where the user can be 
                    able to interact with the elements with ease. That is where React come to 
                    play a part in projects as it make the code more declarative and responsive.
